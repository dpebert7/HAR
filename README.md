## HAR
Human activity recognition using smartphone data.


#### Description
This repository includes code from a data mining project. The data set can be accessed from the  [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The goal of the project is to predict 6 classes of activity (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying) based on data gathered from a cell phone accelerometer and gyroscope.


#### Results
SVM probably gives the best results. More coming.
